            Marijuana cultivation began in the United States around 1600 with the Jamestown settlers, who began growing the cannabis sativa or hemp plant for its unusually strong fiber that was used to make rope, sails, and clothing. that in 1619, Virginia passed a law requiring hemp to be grown on every farm in the colony. At the time, the crop was also considered a proper form of currency in Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania and Maryland. Until after the Civil War, marijuana was a source of major revenue for the United States. During the 19th century marijuana plantations flourished in Mississippi, Georgia, California, South Carolina, Nebraska, New York, and Kentucky. 
            Between 1850 and 1937 marijuana was widely used throughout United States as a medicinal drug and could easily be purchased in pharmacies and general stores. Recreational use was limited in the US until 1910. "Tea pads," where a person could purchase marijuana for 25 cents or less, began appearing in cities across the United States. By 1930 it was reported that there were at least 500 of these "tea pads" in New York City alone. During the Great Depression as unemployment increased, numerous research studies linked marijuana use by lower class communities with crime and violence. In 1937, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act which criminalized the drug. This was the first in line of federal and state legislation to mediate the drug.

            The use of cannabis as medicine has not been rigorously tested due to production and governmental restrictions, resulting in limited clinical research to define the safety and efficacy of using cannabis to treat diseases. Evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy, improving appetite in HIV/AIDS, improving sleep, and improving tics in Tourette syndrome. When usual treatments are ineffective, cannabinoids have also been recommended for anorexia, arthritis, glaucoma, migraine, relief from the spasticity of multiple sclerosis, pain management and posttraumatic stress disorder.
        </p><p>    
            Today the acceptance of the use of Marijuana both medically and recreationally has created an environment in which the American people have to discover the truth and ‘their’ truth. While the fact that marijuana has definite medical uses, is no ‘urban myth,’ it is still not backed by FDA, CDC or widespread scientific approval. Americans have the access, without detailed information. For example, one person may take a multitude of pills, all applicable to different ailments. There are thousands of strains of marijuana and even more derivations of each, within their chemical balancing, all creating different effects in the human body. However, there does not exist a detailed register of which strains would be most effective for particular ailments and combinations thereof. 
        </p><p>  
                Our system, WeedMD, makes a recommendation of marijuana strain depending on your ailment(s). The system, built on current research will continue to learn as users try and rate their recommendations. Ultimately, the system will become so good at making recommendations, that it will begin to create its own modified strains of marijuana focused at covering a multitude of ailments within one prescription. This would educate and empower medical marijuana users to target their symptoms and manage them more effectively.  In addition, dispensary owners and suppliers will gain a competitive advantage by creating state of the art marijuana strains.
